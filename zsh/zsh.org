  #=============
  # '0.sandbox'
  #
  # Unprocessed items that don’t have a place yet in here. It is a temporary
  # folder for files you're messing around with but don't need to save long-term.
  # This may be items like software installers you’ve downloaded, files sent to
  # you from colleagues, random text clippings and testing scripts. Files I
  # decide I want to keep graduate from '0.sandbox' to '1.docs'. This folder must
  # be emptied everyday. To avoid procrastination, resulting in a completely
  # cluttered folder, you can keep a 'janitor' script, deleting its contents
  # regularly.
  SANDBOX=$HOME/0.sandbox/
   
  #=============
  # '1.docs'
  #
  # Is the big kahuna(*) of all the six folders. It's the place where all the
  # working files for your currently in-progress tasks, projects and clients
  # go. Each project gets its own unique folder. You may have many sub-folders in
  # this folder, but don't go deeper than 3 subfolders. This directory changes
  # often and frequently, so you must clean it regularly. Because of this most of
  # the files here are kept under github/gitlab control.
  #
  # (*) Kahuna is a Hawaiian word, defined in Pukui & Elbert (1986) as a "priest,
  # sorcerer, magician, wizard, minister, expert in any profession". (See also
  # Ancient Hawaii.) Forty types of kahuna are listed in the book Tales from the
  # Night Rainbow.
  DOCS=$HOME/1.docs/
   
  #=============
  # '2.archive'
  #
  # Completed projects, general reference items, and anything else which is
  # important and you might want to look at again go here. From here you can
  # create aliases for the default folder from your system, like 'Books' or
  # 'Pictures'.  The files here don't change much if ever, and so you can back
  # them up on a different (less frequent) schedule. Therefore I elected this
  # folder to be actually a symbolic link to my Dropbox folder.
  ARCHIVE=$HOME/2.archive/
   
  #=============
  # 'opt'
  #
  # Third-party software, not present among the official packages.

* Configuration file layout

  Here I define the zshrc file that gets generated by the code in
  this org file.

  #+begin_src shell-script :tangle zsh_aliases.symlink :noweb no-export :exports code
  # Do not modify this file by hand.  It was automatically generated
  # from `zsh.org` in the same directory. See that file for more
  # information.
