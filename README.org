This is my dotfiles repo. I hope you find something useful here!

** Literate programming

[[file:img/org-mode-logo.png]]

Literate programming is a concept in which you write prose and embed in it source code. It has the benefit of being written for humans in the first place. I haven't spent enough time with it to know if this is true, but I suspect it also makes updating the documentation with a given change a little easier as well.

This is another attempt of mine for creating a readable and maintainable dotfiles configuration. I'm hopeful that using Org-Babel and a literate programming style will help tame the (dis)organization.

** Instructions
Clone the repository in a folder of your preference (here I will clone as =.dotfiles=), either from [[https://github.com][GitHub]],
#+begin_src bash
$ git clone https://github.com/padawanphysicist/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
#+end_src
or from [[https://gitlab.com][GitLab]]:
#+begin_src bash
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/padawanphysicist/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
#+end_src
then enter the directory,
#+begin_src bash
$ cd .dotfiles
#+end_src
and link the important files to your =$HOME= directory:
#+begin_src bash
$ ./bootstrap # this will symlink the important files
#+end_src

** Configurations
- [[zsh/zsh.org][zsh shell]]
- [[vim/vim.org][Vim]]
- [[emacs/emacs.org][Emacs]]
